A Ruby-based implementation of a Cisco Type-7 Password Encryptor/Decryptor

## Key Benefits

- **Written in Ruby** - First and only Cisco Type-7 implementation in Ruby that I know of.
- **Minimal/No Dependancies** - Uses native Ruby to do it's work, no heavy dependancies.
- **Not Just a Script** - Implementation is portable for use in another project or for automation of tasks.
- **Simple** - It is a small project so the interfaces are simple and easy to use.
- **Encrypt & Decrypt** - Supports both encryption (with seed control) and decryption operations.

## Setup

To install, type

```bash
gem install c7decrypt
```

To use, just require

```ruby
require 'c7decrypt'
```

## Example Usage(s)

Get an instance of C7Decrypt

```ruby
>> cd = C7Decrypt.new()
=> #<C7Decrypt:0x11b1700>
```

Decrypt A Single Encrypted Passwords

```ruby
>> cd.decrypt("060506324F41")
=> "cisco"
```

Decrypt Array of Encrypted Passwords

```ruby
>> encrypted_hashes = ["060506324F41", "0822455D0A16"]
=> ["060506324F41", "0822455D0A16"]
>> cd.decrypt_array(encrypted_hashes)
=> ["cisco", "cisco"]
```

Decrypt Encrypted Passwords from Config

```ruby
>> cd.decrypt_config("cisco_config.txt")
=> ["cisco", "Password1", "admin"]
```

Encrypt A Single Plaintext Password

```ruby
>> cd.encrypt("cisco")
=> "02050D480809"
```

Encrypt A Single Plaintext Password w/ Explicit Seed

```ruby
>> cd.encrypt("cisco", 6)
=> "060506324F41"
```

Encrypt An Array of Plaintext Passwords

```ruby
>> passwords = ["cisco", "password"]
=> ["cisco", "password"]
>> cd.encrypt_array(passwords)
=> ["02050D480809", "021605481811003348"]
```
